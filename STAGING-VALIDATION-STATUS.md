# Staging Validation Status

## Summary
The requested staging validation tasks could not be completed in this environment because access to the staging deployment, production analytics, and browser testing infrastructure is unavailable from within the container.

## Pending Actions
1. Validate the absence of console errors across all supported browsers/devices on the staging site.
2. Confirm that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) events appear in DebugView while interacting with the staging site.
3. Verify that Google Tag Manager (GTM) and GA4 measurement IDs are present in the deployed assets (e.g., page source, tag injection).
4. After go-live, monitor GA4 DebugView and reports for 24â€“48 hours to ensure event flow stability.
5. Mark conversion events as "Conversions" in GA4 Admin once consistent data capture is confirmed.

## Notes
- Performing these checks requires access to the staging and production environments, browser/device testing tools, and GA4/GTM administration, none of which are available in the current offline container environment.
- Please execute the above tasks using the appropriate staging credentials and analytics tooling, then update this status file with the results.
