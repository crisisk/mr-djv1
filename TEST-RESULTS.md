4. Database connection: Success

---

### 7.2 Frontend Logs ⚠️ WARNING

**Minor Issues Detected:**
```
[error] open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/gtm.js" failed (2: No such file or directory)
[error] open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/index-*.js" failed (2: No such file or directory)
```

**Analysis:**
- `/gtm.js`: Attempted direct file access (GTM is loaded via CDN, not a concern)
- `/assets/index-*.js`: Wildcard pattern request (likely from scanning/probing)

**Status:** WARNING - These are not critical errors. GTM works via CDN, and the wildcard request appears to be external scanning.

**Recommendation:** Monitor for repeated occurrences. Consider adding rate limiting for suspicious request patterns.
