# AGENTS Run Log

## Initialization
- Parsed root AGENTS.md tasks and generated normalized catalog (`TASKS.normalized.json`).
- Constructed dependency graph and batch execution plan.
- Created QA scaffolding directories for e2e artifacts.

## Pending
- Batch B1-foundation remains blocked pending secure secret provisioning and perf tooling access.
- Initiating Batch B2-platform-integration with parallel worker allocation (see details below).

## In Progress
- **B2-platform-integration** (parallel, 4 workers max)
  - Worker W1 → `RG-FE-ADAPT` (frontend service adaptation) — _running_
  - Worker W2 → `T2-1-API-INTEGRATION` (backend handshake) — _running_
  - Worker W3 → `LB-SEVENSA-FLOW` (Sevensa lead sync) — _running_
  - Worker W4 → `T2-3-CONTACT-FLOW` (contact + tracking) — _running_
  - Queue → `T3-4-AB-TESTING` (scheduled once a worker frees up)

## Update – Launched Next Agents (Compliance & Analytics)
- Reallocated workers after RG-FE-ADAPT, T2-1-API-INTEGRATION, LB-SEVENSA-FLOW and T2-3-CONTACT-FLOW reached steady QA hold.
- Spun up **B3-compliance-analytics** with fresh worker assignments:
  - Worker W1 → `LB-COMPLIANZ` (consent automation alignment) — _running_
  - Worker W2 → `T1-1-GTM` (GTM container rollout) — _running_
  - Worker W3 → `T1-2-COMPLIANZ` (cookie banner configuration) — _running_
  - Worker W4 → `LB-STAGING-VALIDATION` (staging validation sweep) — _running_
- Queue → `RG-DOCS` (awaiting worker bandwidth) and `T3-4-AB-TESTING` (to resume after compliance batch)

## Parallel Execution Overview
- **B2-platform-integration** → RG-FE-ADAPT, T2-1-API-INTEGRATION, LB-SEVENSA-FLOW, T2-3-CONTACT-FLOW, T3-4-AB-TESTING
- **B3-compliance-analytics** → LB-COMPLIANZ, T1-1-GTM, T1-2-COMPLIANZ, LB-STAGING-VALIDATION, RG-DOCS
- **B4-brand-content** → T2-2-BRANDING, T2-4-SCHEMA, T2-5-TESTIMONIALS, T3-1-CAROUSEL, T3-2-CLIENT-LOGOS, T3-3-ABOUT, T3-6-SOCIAL
