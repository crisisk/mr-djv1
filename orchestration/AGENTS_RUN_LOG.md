# AGENTS Run Log

## Initialization
- Parsed root AGENTS.md tasks and generated normalized catalog (`TASKS.normalized.json`).
- Constructed dependency graph and batch execution plan.
- Created QA scaffolding directories for e2e artifacts.

## Pending
- Batch B1-foundation remains blocked pending secure secret provisioning and perf tooling access.
- QA verification is still underway for Batch B2-platform-integration deliverables.
- Sequential Batch B5-performance-hardening will kick off once sign-off is granted on the QA backlog.

## QA Hold
- **B2-platform-integration** (parallel, 4 workers max)
  - Worker W1 → `RG-FE-ADAPT` (frontend service adaptation) — _QA hold_
  - Worker W2 → `T2-1-API-INTEGRATION` (backend handshake) — _QA hold_
  - Worker W3 → `LB-SEVENSA-FLOW` (Sevensa lead sync) — _QA hold_
  - Worker W4 → `T2-3-CONTACT-FLOW` (contact + tracking) — _QA hold_

## Update – Compliance Batch Wrapped & Next Wave Launched
- Completed **B3-compliance-analytics** handoff (all workers moved to QA verification; findings logged in staging tracker).
- Spun up **B4-brand-content** with refreshed worker assignments to tackle outstanding customer-facing work:
  - Worker W1 → `T2-2-BRANDING` (favicon & header brand alignment) — _running_
  - Worker W2 → `T2-4-SCHEMA` (Schema.org expansion) — _running_
  - Worker W3 → `T2-5-TESTIMONIALS` (centralized testimonials feed) — _running_
  - Worker W4 → `RG-DOCS` (integration rollout documentation) — _running_
- Queue → `T3-4-AB-TESTING` (awaiting analytics bandwidth), `T3-1-CAROUSEL`, `T3-2-CLIENT-LOGOS`, `T3-3-ABOUT`, `T3-6-SOCIAL`

## Execution – Parallel Tasks Cleared
- Ran two waves of parallel work to empty the B4-brand-content queue:
  - **Wave 1:** W1 delivered `T2-2-BRANDING`, W2 finalized `T2-4-SCHEMA`, W3 centralized feeds for `T2-5-TESTIMONIALS`, and W4 published the `RG-DOCS` rollout guide.
  - **Wave 2:** With capacity freed, W1 shipped `T3-1-CAROUSEL`, W2 produced the `T3-2-CLIENT-LOGOS` strip, W3 authored the `T3-3-ABOUT` section, and W4 executed the `T3-6-SOCIAL` metadata refresh alongside the queued `T3-4-AB-TESTING` runbook.
- All parallel-eligible deliverables are now completed; workers returned to idle status pending the sequential B5-performance-hardening kickoff.
