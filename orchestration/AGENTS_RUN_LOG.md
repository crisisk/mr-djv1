## Initialization
- Parsed root AGENTS.md tasks and generated normalized catalog (`TASKS.normalized.json`).
- Constructed dependency graph and batch execution plan.
- Created QA scaffolding directories for e2e artifacts.

- Initiating Batch B2-platform-integration with parallel worker allocation (see details below).

## In Progress
- **B2-platform-integration** (parallel, 4 workers max)

  - Worker W2 → `T2-1-API-INTEGRATION` (backend handshake) — _QA hold_
  - Worker W3 → `LB-SEVENSA-FLOW` (Sevensa lead sync) — _QA hold_
  - Worker W4 → `T2-3-CONTACT-FLOW` (contact + tracking) — _QA hold_
