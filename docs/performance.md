# Performance Enhancements – October 2025

## Overview
- **Gallery optimizations**: The organisms gallery (HTML + React mirror) now lazy loads imagery and defers autoplay until videos enter the viewport. This reduces initial network cost and minimizes layout thrash during page load.
- **Video handling**: Intersection Observers manage playback for any element flagged with `data-autoplay="true"`. Videos pause and reset when they leave the viewport, preventing background CPU/bandwidth usage.

## Lighthouse Impact
- Expect improved **LCP** and **Total Blocking Time** scores when running Lighthouse on gallery-heavy templates due to deferred media loading.
- Validate via `npx lighthouse http://localhost:5173/organisms-gallery --config-path=scripts/performance/lighthouse.config.cjs` (adjust the URL as needed when the gallery is mounted) to confirm the gallery maintains ≥90 performance on both desktop and mobile modes.
- Ensure screenshots or video evidence for regressions are attached to `docs/test-reports/performance-summary.md` when rerunning audits.

## Follow-up Actions
- Monitor autoplay metrics in production analytics to confirm engagement is unaffected.
- Consider swapping placeholder CDN assets for locally optimised media before launch to avoid third-party latency.
