# Accessibility Compliance Report

## Overview
- Added `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to the frontend toolchain and updated the ESLint flat config to enforce accessibility-focused rules.
- Executed `npm run lint` to validate the updated configuration; the command now passes with zero accessibility violations.

## Remediation Summary
- Converted click-only `div` containers in generated components to semantic buttons, adding keyboard support and ARIA metadata where applicable (e.g., video gallery cards, pricing extras, event selectors, and mood board scheme tiles).
- Enhanced interactive controls with keyboard handlers, roles, and live regions (before/after slider, payment status messaging, testimonial overlays).
- Ensured all embedded media provide caption tracks and descriptive labelling to satisfy `jsx-a11y/media-has-caption` requirements.
- Removed unused hooks/imports and clarified status messaging to prevent stale announcements and improve screen reader feedback.

## Current Status
- **Lint command:** `npm run lint`
- **Result:** Pass (no accessibility lint errors)
- **Last run:** 2025-10-20 18:10:24 UTC

The generated components located under `frontend/src/components/Generated/` now comply with the enforced accessibility lint rules.
