# Production Readiness Report

## Summary
- Status: 🔴 Not Ready
- Focus: Execute Batch A → Batch B → Batch C as outlined in `BATCH_EXECUTION_READINESS.md` to close all launch blockers.
- Notes: Secrets still outstanding for Batch A, preventing backend config validation and downstream integration testing.

## Checklist Snapshot
- [ ] CI build clean (`npm run build`)
- [ ] TypeScript checks pass
- [ ] ESLint clean
- [ ] Storybook build validated
- [ ] Lighthouse ≥ 90 (LCP, TBT, SEO)
- [ ] Playwright smoke tests green
- [ ] Accessibility scan < 5 minor issues

## Batch Execution Tracker

| Batch | Scope | Status | Exit Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Batch A – Platform Foundation | Secrets, Complianz/GTM/GA4, consent QA | 🔴 Blocked (waiting on credential handoff) | `backend/.env` + `backend/managed.env` validated via `npm --prefix backend test`; consent banner smoke test recording |
| Batch B – Experience Integration | RentGuy proxy, Sevensa flow, regression automation | ⏳ Pending (requires Batch A completion) | Cypress/Playwright suites green, availability checker posts through backend, GA4 events logged in DebugView |
| Batch C – Launch & Monitoring | Performance, monitoring, production deploy | ⏳ Pending | Lighthouse ≥90 report, monitoring dashboards, signed `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` |

## Next Steps
1. Provision backend and marketing secrets (Batch A) and capture validation artifacts.
2. Enable frontend/backend integration work once Batch A is complete; keep test coverage growing with each feature (Batch B).
3. Prepare launch checklists, monitoring, and deployment dry run scripts ahead of Batch C to shorten the go-live runway.
