# Production Readiness Report

## Summary
- Status: 🟠 In Progress
- Focus: Execute Batch A → Batch B → Batch C as outlined in `BATCH_EXECUTION_READINESS.md` to close all launch blockers.
- Notes: Secrets placeholders and validation workflows are now documented. Backend env schemas can be validated locally, unblocking credential provisioning. Consent-driven GTM loading reacts to runtime consent changes.

## Checklist Snapshot
- [ ] CI build clean (`npm run build`)
- [ ] TypeScript checks pass
- [ ] ESLint clean
- [ ] Storybook build validated
- [ ] Lighthouse ≥ 90 (LCP, TBT, SEO)
- [ ] Playwright smoke tests green
- [ ] Accessibility scan < 5 minor issues

## Batch Execution Tracker

| Batch | Scope | Status | Exit Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Batch A – Platform Foundation | Secrets, Complianz/GTM/GA4, consent QA | 🟡 In Progress | `backend/.env` + `backend/managed.env` validated via `npm --prefix backend test`; consent banner smoke test recording |
| Batch B – Experience Integration | RentGuy proxy, Sevensa flow, regression automation | ⏳ Pending (requires Batch A completion) | Cypress/Playwright suites green, availability checker posts through backend, GA4 events logged in DebugView |
| Batch C – Launch & Monitoring | Performance, monitoring, production deploy | ⏳ Pending | Lighthouse ≥90 report, monitoring dashboards, signed `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` |

### Batch Updates

- **Batch A – Platform Foundation**
  - Added `backend/.env.example` and `backend/managed.env.example` to capture every validated secret, clarifying which credentials must be stored in secret management versus developer overrides.
  - Updated `backend/README.md` with step-by-step instructions for copying the templates and running the Joi-powered validator so credential handoff can be completed without guesswork.
- **Batch B – Experience Integration**
  - Hardened the consent-aware GTM loader so it listens for runtime consent changes and avoids referencing undefined globals, ensuring analytics only boot once marketing consent is granted.
- **Batch C – Launch & Monitoring**
  - No new work this iteration. Pending once Batch A/B deliverables are signed off.

## Next Steps
1. Provision backend and marketing secrets (Batch A) using the new managed env templates and rerun `npm --prefix backend test` for validation evidence.
2. Extend integration coverage (Batch B) now that `/availability/check` proxies to Sevensa through the backend; capture Cypress scenarios for booking/contact parity.
3. Prepare launch checklists, monitoring, and deployment dry run scripts ahead of Batch C to shorten the go-live runway.
