# Production Readiness Report

## Summary
- Status: 🟡 In Progress
- Focus: Batch A groundwork completed for environment provisioning and consent-controlled analytics; proceed with credential handoff and integration hardening before Batch C sign-off.
- Notes: Secrets still outstanding for Batch A, but validated scaffolding (`backend/.env.sample`, `backend/managed.env.sample`) and consent manager wiring unblock credential import.

## Checklist Snapshot
- [ ] CI build clean (`npm run build`)
- [ ] TypeScript checks pass
- [ ] ESLint clean
- [ ] Storybook build validated
- [ ] Lighthouse ≥ 90 (LCP, TBT, SEO)
- [ ] Playwright smoke tests green
- [ ] Accessibility scan < 5 minor issues

## Batch Execution Tracker

| Batch | Scope | Status | Exit Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Batch A – Platform Foundation | Secrets, Complianz/GTM/GA4, consent QA | 🟡 In Progress (env scaffolding merged; awaiting secret injection) | `backend/.env.sample` & `backend/managed.env.sample`; consent banner controls GTM/GA4 & Facebook Pixel via `ConsentManager.jsx` |
| Batch B – Experience Integration | RentGuy proxy, Sevensa flow, regression automation | ⏳ Pending (requires Batch A completion) | Cypress/Playwright suites green, availability checker posts through backend, GA4 events logged in DebugView |
| Batch C – Launch & Monitoring | Performance, monitoring, production deploy | ⏳ Pending | Lighthouse ≥90 report, monitoring dashboards, signed `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` |

## Next Steps
1. Provision backend and marketing secrets (Batch A) using the new managed env templates and rerun `npm --prefix backend test` for validation evidence.
2. Extend integration coverage (Batch B) now that `/availability/check` proxies to Sevensa through the backend; capture Cypress scenarios for booking/contact parity.
3. Prepare launch checklists, monitoring, and deployment dry run scripts ahead of Batch C to shorten the go-live runway.
