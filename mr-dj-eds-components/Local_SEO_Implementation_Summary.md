# Local SEO Page Implementation Summary (Task T5)

**Project:** Mr. DJ Website Development (mr-dj.nl)
**Task:** T5: Local Pages for 50+ cities in Brabant/Limburg
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Overview and Goal
The goal of this phase was to implement a reusable, SEO-optimized template component (`LocalSeoPage.jsx`) to generate over 50 city-specific landing pages for local search visibility in the Noord-Brabant and Limburg regions. This implementation adheres to the Enterprise Design System (EDS) and leverages existing components.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. Data Structure (`src/data/local_seo_data.js`)
A dedicated JavaScript file was created to house the city-specific content. This structure allows for easy management and dynamic content injection, which is crucial for SEO optimization.

| Field Name | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `city` | The name of the city (e.g., "Eindhoven") | Primary content variable |
| `province` | The name of the province (e.g., "Noord-Brabant") | Secondary content variable for broader context |
| `slug` | URL-friendly identifier (e.g., "eindhoven") | Used for routing and data retrieval |
| `localUSP` | Unique Selling Proposition localized to the city | Hero section subtitle, SEO content |
| `localReviews` | A sample testimonial localized to the city | Testimonial section content |
| `localVenues` | A list of known venues in the city | Local relevance and trust signals |
| `seoTitle` | Custom `<title>` tag content | Critical for on-page SEO |
| `seoDescription` | Custom `<meta name="description">` content | Critical for on-page SEO |

### 2.2. Component Implementation (`src/components/Templates/LocalSeoPage.jsx`)
The `LocalSeoPage` component was implemented as a template, dynamically rendering content based on the `data` prop it receives.

**Key Features:**
*   **SEO Integration:** Uses `react-helmet` to dynamically set the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags based on the `seoTitle` and `seoDescription` fields from the data.
*   **Component Reusability:** Integrates existing EDS components:
    *   `HeroSection`: Used for the main city-specific header.
    *   `PricingTables`: Reused to display service packages.
    *   `Testimonials`: Reused, with a localized quote (`localReviews`) displayed above it for relevance.
*   **Dynamic Content:** All text elements, including the main headings, CTAs, and venue lists, are dynamically populated with city and province names to maximize local relevance and keyword density.

### 2.3. Integration and Testing (`src/App.jsx`)
The component was integrated into `App.jsx` for testing purposes. It imports the `localSeoData` and passes the data for the first city (Eindhoven) to the `LocalSeoPage` component. This setup confirms that the component correctly receives and renders the dynamic content.

## 3. Next Steps (Roadmap)

The implementation of the `LocalSeoPage` component is complete. The next logical steps on the roadmap are:

1.  **T6: Router Implementation:** Implement a routing solution (e.g., React Router) to handle the 50+ city slugs and pass the correct data to the `LocalSeoPage` component based on the URL.
2.  **T7: Final Content Generation:** Finalize the content for all 50+ cities in the `local_seo_data.js` file.
3.  **T8: Deployment Preparation:** Prepare the application for deployment, including build scripts and environment configuration.

The project is now ready to proceed to the routing and final content generation phase. All changes, including the files provided by the user, have been committed and pushed to the `crisisk/mr-djv1` repository.
