---

### 4. DELETED FILES ON REMOTE (145+)

Remote deleted many files that local may still reference:
- `backend/src/app.js` - DELETED (local server.js references it)
- `backend/src/config.js` - DELETED
- `backend/src/routes/*.js` - ALL DELETED
- `backend/src/services/*.js` - ALL DELETED (RentGuy, Sevensa, etc.)
- `backend/src/lib/*.js` - ALL DELETED (logger, cache, redis, telemetry)
- `backend/src/middleware/*.js` - ALL DELETED
- All backend tests - DELETED
- Old frontend files at root - DELETED
- City page HTML files - DELETED (moved to React components?)

**Impact Analysis:**
- Local's `server.js` doesn't reference deleted files (good!)
- Remote has new architecture - need to understand it
- Old services (RentGuy, Sevensa) removed - but task mentioned integrating them?

**Action Required:**
- Verify remote's new service location
- Check if RentGuy/Sevensa were moved or removed
- Confirm backend test strategy

---

### 5. NEW FILES ON REMOTE (~50+)

New documentation and features:
- `LANDINGPAGES.md` - Landing page documentation
- `PROJECT.md` - Project overview (721 lines!)
- `SCHEMA_ORG_TEST.md` - Schema.org testing (254 lines)
- `TODO.md` - Todo list (324 lines)
- New components: `Logo.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `CookieConsent.jsx`, `ContactForm.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, `AboutUs.jsx`
- New services: `mr-dj-eds-components/src/services/api.js`

**Merge Strategy:**
- ACCEPT all new documentation files
- INTEGRATE new components with local's versions
- Resolve component duplicates (e.g., two `ContactForm.jsx`)

---

## Key Areas of Integration

### 1. Backend API Architecture
**Challenge:** Local has simple Express server, remote has complex modular system

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Start with local's simple `server.js`
2. Add remote's modular features as optional imports
3. Create feature flags for observability, telemetry, queues
4. Keep local's `/contact` endpoint as primary
5. Add remote's dashboard routes as separate module

### 2. Frontend Component Structure
**Challenge:** Both branches have different component organizations

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Use local's component import paths (canonical)
2. Merge remote's new components where they don't conflict
3. Preserve local's GA4 tracking in all components
4. Add remote's AB testing as opt-in feature
5. Keep local's Schema.org implementations

### 3. GA4 & Analytics
**Challenge:** Local has GTM/GA4, remote may have different analytics

**Resolution Plan:**
1. KEEP local's GTM implementation
2. KEEP all local GA4 tracking code
3. INTEGRATE remote's analytics modules if compatible
4. Ensure consent management covers all tracking

### 4. Domain & Routing
**Challenge:** Different domains and path structures

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Use local's domain: `mr-dj.sevensa.nl`
2. Use local's simplified routing (no `/eds` prefix)
3. Update all CORS, CSP, and security headers
4. Verify Traefik configuration

## Merge Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Safety
1. ✅ Create backup (already done)
2. ✅ Analyze differences (this document)
3. Create merge branch: `merge-origin-main-20251019`
4. Commit all local changes first
5. Document current state

### Phase 2: Merge Attempt
1. Fetch latest from origin
2. Create safety branch
3. Attempt merge: `git merge origin/main`
4. Expect conflicts in ~15-20 files

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution Priority Order
1. **First:** `backend/src/server.js` - Most critical
2. **Second:** `docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure
3. **Third:** `DjSaxLanding.jsx` - Main landing page
4. **Fourth:** Other component files with GA4
5. **Fifth:** Config files (package.json, etc.)
6. **Last:** Documentation files

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Build frontend: `npm run build`
2. Start containers: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Test health endpoint: `/health`
4. Test contact form: `/contact`
5. Verify GA4 tracking
6. Check Schema.org validation
7. Test all user flows

### Phase 5: Documentation
1. Create `MERGE-REPORT.md` - What was merged
2. Create `MERGE-CONFLICTS-RESOLVED.md` - How conflicts were resolved
3. Update `PROJECT.md` with merge notes
4. Document any features disabled/postponed

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- Backup location: `/opt/mr-dj-backup-20251019-current.tar.gz`
- Can restore with: `cd /opt && tar -xzf mr-dj-backup-20251019-current.tar.gz`
- Git reflog available for 30 days

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Frontend builds without errors
- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] All API endpoints respond
- [ ] GA4 tracking fires correctly
- [ ] Schema.org validates
- [ ] Contact form submits to database
- [ ] Docker containers start correctly
- [ ] Traefik routes work on `mr-dj.sevensa.nl`

### Fallback Strategy
If merge fails catastrophically:
1. `git merge --abort`
2. Review conflicts in detail
3. Consider cherry-picking specific commits
4. Or: merge in smaller batches (feature by feature)

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **RentGuy/Sevensa CRM:** Task mentioned integrating it, but remote deleted these services. Where are they now?
2. **Backend Tests:** Remote deleted all tests. Is there a new test strategy?
3. **City Pages:** Old HTML city pages deleted. Are they now React components?
4. **Observability:** Remote has complex observability. Do we need it for local's simple API?
5. **AB Testing:** Remote has AB testing framework. Is this a required feature?

---

## Estimated Conflict Count

Based on diff analysis:
- **High-priority conflicts:** 3-5 files (server.js, docker-compose.yml, DjSaxLanding.jsx)
- **Medium-priority conflicts:** 10-15 files (other components, configs)
- **Low-priority conflicts:** 5-10 files (documentation, minor files)
- **Total estimated:** 18-30 conflicted files

**Resolution Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours for careful, thorough merge

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Complete this analysis** (DONE)
2. **Commit all local changes** to have clean working directory
3. **Create merge branch** for safety
4. **Attempt merge** and document conflicts
5. **Resolve conflicts** following priority order above
6. **Test thoroughly** per testing requirements
7. **Document everything** in final reports

---

## Notes

- Local changes are well-structured and focused (GA4, API, Schema.org)
- Remote changes are extensive but architectural (refactoring, new features)
- Main challenge: reconciling two different backend architectures
- Key success factor: preserving ALL local features while integrating remote improvements
- Documentation will be critical for understanding merge decisions

**Recommendation:** Proceed with merge using safety branch. Take time to carefully resolve each conflict. Test thoroughly before considering merge complete.
