# Pending Integration Tasks & Batch Assignment

## Source Summary
- **Integration conflicts**: Tasks `DEV3.2` and `DEV3.5` were skipped during the previous automation run because of file conflicts. These remain unresolved and must be reattempted manually. (Ref: `INTEGRATION_REPORT.json`)
- **Next integration actions**: The success report outlines six follow-up steps required to fully operationalize the integrated components. (Ref: `INTEGRATION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md`)

## Pending Task Breakdown
1. **DEV3.2 – Event-type based personalization**
   - Resolve the skipped integration affecting `EventTypeSelector.css` and ensure the personalization logic is wired up inside the booking flow.
2. **DEV3.5 – User behavior recording**
   - Reconcile the skipped changes intended for `src/App.jsx` so that the tracking module initializes correctly.
3. **Review generated components**
   - Perform a manual audit of the 50 autogenerated components inside `/opt/mr-dj/frontend/src/components/Generated/`.
4. **Import components in `App.tsx`**
   - Wire the vetted components into the application shell and verify the rendering order.
5. **Create pages and routes**
   - Build page containers and routing definitions that consume the integrated components.
6. **Add backend integration (Phase 3)**
   - Connect frontend booking and analytics flows to the backend services and APIs planned for Phase 3.
7. **Test functionality**
   - Execute end-to-end verification covering booking, analytics, and personalization features.
8. **Deploy to production**
   - Prepare the deployment pipeline and release the updated build.

## Upcoming Batch Assignments
- **Batch A – Frontend Stabilization (Immediate)**
  - Tasks: DEV3.2 conflict fix, DEV3.5 conflict fix, review generated components, import priority components into `App.tsx`.
  - Goal: Deliver a stable frontend baseline with personalization and tracking restored.
- **Batch B – Experience Expansion (Next)**
  - Tasks: Build pages/routes, complete component wiring for customer journeys, begin backend API hookups required for booking flows.
  - Goal: Unlock navigable experiences that exercise the generated components across event scenarios.
- **Batch C – Full Integration & Launch (Following)**
  - Tasks: Finish backend integration work, run comprehensive functional testing, execute production deployment.
  - Goal: Ship a production-ready release with analytics, personalization, and booking fully operational.

## Notes
- Reassess batch scope after Batch A completes to confirm no additional blockers emerge from the conflict resolution work.
- Ensure coordination with backend owners before starting Batch B to validate API contracts and availability.
