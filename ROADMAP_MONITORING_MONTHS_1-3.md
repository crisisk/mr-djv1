# Monitoring-Ready Roadmap: Months 1–3

## Overview
This roadmap clusters the first-quarter deliverables into monitoring-aware tickets. Each ticket is anchored to the telemetry signals that justify the work, and dependencies call out the monitoring prerequisites required for launch readiness.

## Month 1 Tickets
1. **Ticket M1-OBS-101 — Stand up GA4 & Log Stream Baseline**  
   *Deliverables*: finalize GA4 property configuration, enable server-side tagging, deploy centralized log forwarding.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: GA4 real-time dashboards and log ingestion alerts must be confirmed operational prior to hand-off.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Addresses recent GA4 session sampling spikes that obscure latency signals; reliable data unlocks downstream anomaly detection.
2. **Ticket M1-CDN-201 — CDN Warm-Up Experimentation**  
   *Deliverables*: pilot CDN activation on high-traffic landing pages, configure cache invalidation playbooks.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Requires synthetic latency monitors tied to GA4 page-speed metrics to verify cache hit rate improvements.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Triggered by GA4-reported latency increases during peak campaigns; experiment seeks to flatten TTFB variance.
3. **Ticket M1-FORM-301 — Conversion Funnel Instrumentation**  
   *Deliverables*: add enhanced form completion events, enrich consent banners with trace IDs, document funnel schema.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Depends on consolidated GA4 + Consent Manager dashboards to validate event completeness before rollout.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Responds to declining lead submissions flagged in monthly KPI digests; richer instrumentation isolates drop-off points.

## Month 2 Tickets
1. **Ticket M2-ALRT-110 — Monitoring Readiness Certification**  
   *Deliverables*: publish monitoring runbooks, establish alert severity matrix, conduct on-call dry run.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Completion of M1-OBS-101 baseline is mandatory; certification gates all feature launches.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Ensures continued visibility into GA4 latency and conversion trends noted in Month 1 by formalizing alert responses.
2. **Ticket M2-CDN-220 — Full-Site CDN Rollout**  
   *Deliverables*: expand CDN coverage to all static assets, implement regional edge rules, update deployment automation.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Requires green status from M2-ALRT-110 certification plus live TTFB dashboards with GA4 overlays.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Builds on improved latency trends from M1-CDN-201 experiments; targets sustained 20% reduction in TTFB variance.
3. **Ticket M2-SEO-330 — Search Visibility Guardrails**  
   *Deliverables*: integrate schema validation monitors, automate sitemap freshness checks, add GA4 organic cohort reports.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Needs log-based crawler anomaly detection activated in M1-OBS-101 and alerting playbooks from M2-ALRT-110.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Responds to plateauing organic sessions observed in KPI dashboards; guardrails prevent further erosion.

## Month 3 Tickets
1. **Ticket M3-PERF-140 — Core Web Vitals Optimization Sprint**  
   *Deliverables*: ship prioritized LCP/CLS fixes, deploy code-splitting, audit third-party scripts.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Requires real-time CWV telemetry correlated with GA4 engagement to prove impact; depends on alert matrix from M2-ALRT-110.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Targets residual GA4 LCP alerts that persist post-CDN rollout; success measured by sustained green scores.
2. **Ticket M3-CONV-250 — Personalization Experiment Suite**  
   *Deliverables*: launch geo-targeted hero variants, integrate recommendation widgets, configure experiment logging.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Depends on conversion funnel instrumentation from M1-FORM-301 and monitoring certification from M2-ALRT-110 to ensure clean reads.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Activated by modest uptick in abandonment rates; experiments aim to lift GA4 goal completion trendlines.
3. **Ticket M3-RET-360 — Retention Signal Enhancements**  
   *Deliverables*: enrich lifecycle segments, deploy churn propensity dashboards, integrate NPS survey analytics.  
   *Monitoring Dependency*: Needs authenticated user telemetry pipelines validated by M1-OBS-101 and alert automation from M2-ALRT-110.  
   *KPI Trend Alignment*: Addresses flattening repeat-visit metrics surfaced in quarterly KPI review; dashboards track cohort health post-launch.

## Quarterly Review Cadence
- **Q1 Review (End of Month 3)**: Align completed work with GA4 latency, conversion, and retention trend reports; adjust backlog for Q2 based on KPI deltas.  
- **Q2 Review (End of Month 6)**: Evaluate impact of personalization and retention initiatives against updated benchmarks; reprioritize roadmap tickets as needed.  
- **Q3 Review (End of Month 9)**: Cross-check monitoring efficacy, focusing on alert fatigue and false positives; feed learnings into optimization backlog.  
- **Q4 Review (End of Month 12)**: Consolidate annual KPI trends with backlog outcomes, resetting monitoring readiness requirements for upcoming strategic goals.

Each quarterly meeting includes:  
1. Review of KPI dashboards and anomaly logs.  
2. Comparison of achieved outcomes versus ticket hypotheses.  
3. Backlog refinement to insert, retire, or resequence roadmap items based on evidence gathered.
